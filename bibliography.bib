  abstract = {Over a decade after RDF has been published as a W3C recommendation, publishing open and machine-readable content on the Web has recently received a lot more attention, including from corporate and governmental bodies; notably thanks to the Linked Open Data community, there now exists a rich vein of heterogeneous RDF data published on the Web (the so-called \textbackslash Web of Data") accessible to all. However, RDF publishers are prone to making errors which compromise the e ectiveness of applications leveraging the resulting data. In this paper, we discuss common errors in RDF publishing, their consequences for applications, along with possible publisher-oriented approaches to improve the quality of structured, machine-readable and open data on the We}

  abstract = {The XSD binary floating point datatypes are regularly used for precise numeric values in RDF. However, the use of these datatypes for knowledge representation can systematically impair the quality of data and, compared to the XSD decimal datatype, increases the probability of data processing producing false results. We argue why in most cases the XSD decimal datatype is better suited to represent numeric values in RDF. A survey of the actual usage of datatypes on the relevant subset of the December 2020 Web Data Commons dataset, containing 19 453 060 341 literals from real web data, substantiates the practical relevancy of the described problem: 29\%–68\% of binary floating point values are distorted due to the datatype.},
